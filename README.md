# CoCreative-System-for-Music-Generation
This is the final assignment of the course *Computational Creativity*, where we designed and implemented a co-creative system for music generation using genetic algorithms and user feedback.

This assignment is divided into several subtasks:
1. Research on co-creativity.
2. Implementation of a co-creative system.
3. Evaluation of the co-creative system.

The overall process is described and analyzed in file *Weird_Science.pdf*
